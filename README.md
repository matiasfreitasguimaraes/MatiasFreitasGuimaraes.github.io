# Left

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/), which means it was
battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear
words.

You can see it live right here: <http://zachholman.com/left/>
